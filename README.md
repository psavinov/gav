# Goals and Values analyzer
Goals &amp; Values React app

In 2019 I published a post here about possible planning/goals setting approach.
Since when I collected some feedback about that approach and converted it into React-based web app. 
Now you can try it in the automated way here https://psavinov.github.io
Any comments are very welcome ;)

## How it works?

First of all, app asks you to introduce yourself, but if you're ok with it you can continue as a anonymous "Friend".

In the second step you can define your core values, choosing some from the list or entering your own.

Next step is values rating - assign each value a priority, from 1 to 5.

When all values are rated it is time to set some goals.

And repeat the rating process with the goals.

And that is it, enjoy the results. You can share the results in your social networks.
